      "title": "Tesla holds lowest vehicle price increase rate as new car prices hit all-time high",
      "description": "Tesla has the lowest vehicle price increase rate from September 2020 to September 2021 of all major automotive manufacturers, a study from Kelley Blue Book shows. The average price of a new car has hit an all-time high in the United States with the average cost increasing by 3.7% from August 2021 to September 2021. The average price of a new car now sits at $45,031.\nKBB data shows the rate of pricing increases from major automakers globally. While every car company in the world was forced to increase prices due to semiconductor shortages and supply chain bottlenecks, the variance of each rate increase was dependent on the automaker. However, some car companies hiked prices significantly more than others. The same cannot be said for Tesla, which increased prices the least of any automaker, and by a considerable margin.\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\nData from the KBB study shows Tesla’s prices increased by only 1.5% from September 2020 to September 2021. The industry average was 12.1%, mainly driven up by Daimler, which saw 25.8% price increases in the same time period. Other automakers with over 20% price increase rates included Mitsubishi (23.8%), and General Motors (21.6%). The two car companies with the smallest increases were Tesla and Subaru, which only increased prices Year-over-Year by 6.3%.\n\n\n\nCredit: Kelley Blue Book\n\n\n\nTesla’s only sub-$40,000 vehicle is actually the Tesla Cybertruck’s Single Motor variant, which is not scheduled to be built for several years as the company is prioritizing the more expensive, but more capable Dual and Tri-Motor configurations. The Cybertruck will be built at Tesla’s Gigafactory Texas in Austin.\nThe supply chain shortages were not the only thing to blame for the hike in average new car prices, according to KBB’s report. In fact, buyer preferences also helped the average cost of a vehicle go up considerably. KBB said, “the vehicle mix shifted in September away from lower-priced sedans, compacts and entry-level segments toward more-expensive pickups, SUVs and the luxury market.”\nCox Automotive analyst Kayla Reynolds said that September saw a drastic jump in midsize SUV sales compared to August. Full-sized pickup trucks also saw a spike in sales, as well.  “Sales of lower-priced compact and midsize cars, which had been commanding more share during the summer, faded in September. As long as new-vehicle inventory remains tight, we believe prices will remain elevated,” Reynolds added.\nTesla has increased prices of its vehicles on several occasions this year due to demand and parts shortages. However, the most affordable vehicle from the company, the Model 3 SR+, still remains under the national average new car price at $41,990.\nDon’t hesitate to contact us with tips!

      "description": "Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) shareholders voted overwhelmingly to retain Kimbal Musk, brother of CEO Elon Musk, and James Murdoch on Tesla’s Board of Directors, according to an 8-K filing with the SEC that revealed the number of votes to re-elect the two to the company’s Board for three more years.\nOn October 13th, Tesla filed an 8-K form with the SEC that revealed the number of votes that supported or were against the re-election of both Kimbal Musk and James Murdoch to the Tesla Board. The number of votes for other proposals was also revealed. However, prior to the company’s 2021 Shareholder Meeting on October 7th, proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services, or ISS, urged Tesla investors to oust both Musk and Murdoch from the Board. Their reasoning was based on the belief that the two non-executive board members did not present any advantages to the automaker’s governance.\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\n“Votes AGAINST directors James Murdoch and Kimbal Musk are warranted due to concerns regarding excessive compensation to named executive officers and to non-executive directors,” ISS wrote in a note to investors. The firm was adamant that Kimbal’s payout package was not necessarily logical for the company as he did not serve on any board committees. Additionally, ISS felt that Murdoch’s presence on the Tesla Board of Directors also was not justified due to his service on Audit and Governance Committees. The Audit Committee pledged a large sum of company stock to directors, which raised questions regarding its risk oversight. The Governance Committee failed to react appropriately to last year’s Shareholder proposal, which was supported by the majority of voters.\nCEO Elon Musk, Kimbal’s brother, did not support the suggestion, calling ISS “ISIS” in reference to a radical Jihadist group.\n\n“ISIS”\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 27, 2021\n\n\nTesla Shareholders were evidently not supportive of ISS’ suggestions, either. 411,565,464 Shareholders voted in favor of Murdoch’s retention as a board member, while 473,486,890 supported Kimbal staying on. 175,158,627 and 117,345,144 voted against Murdoch and Kimbal being granted three more years on the Board, respectively.\n“The individuals listed below [Murdoch and Kimbal Musk] were elected as Class II directors at the Annual Meeting to serve on Tesla’s Board of Directors (“Board”) for a term of three years or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified,” Tesla said in the filing.\nAt the time of writing, Tesla shares were up .70%, trading at $816.95.\nDisclosure: Joey Klender is a TSLA Shareholder.\nDon’t hesitate to contact us with tips!

      "description": "Tesla has now raised over $1 billion on its Bitcoin investment as the price of the cryptocurrency nears $58,000, for the first time since May. The electric car producer originally invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin, and its investment is now worth about $2.5 billion.According to Bitcoin Magazine's assumptions, Tesla owns 43,200 BTC, which is nearly $2.5 billion at the time of this writing. On February 8, the manufacturer announced that it had updated its investment policy to give itself more flexibility to further diversify and increase the return on its cash, and had acquired $1.5 billion in Bitcoin cryptocurrency. Although the purchase price of the crypto coin was not disclosed, it is reported that the purchase was made in January.Tesla sold 10% of its Bitcoin in Q2 at an average price of about $50,000 per token. CEO Elon Musk later tweeted that Tesla sold 10% of its Bitcoin assets to prove the asset's liquidity and viability as an alternative to cash on its balance sheet. In June, he also wrote that Tesla owns less than 42,069 Bitcoins, although that that number is close. In its Q2 earnings report, Tesla announced that it made a $128 million profit from the sale of Bitcoin.So it is estimated that, since the initial investment in Bitcoin, the carmaker has gained roughly 65%, which equates to roughly $1 billion. In comparison, this is the same as its revenue from the sale of approximately 201,000 vehicles in Q2.\n\n© 2021, Eva Fox | Tesmanian.

      "description": "Tesla’s planned expansion of the Kettleman City Supercharger in California is evidently underway. The expansion will bring 56 additional V3 Supercharger stalls to the Kettleman City station, bringing the grand total to 96, supplementing the 40-already existing chargers at the site.\nTesla’s Kettleman City Supercharger is one of the most popular in the world. The site not only has 40 Superchargers, some of which already have V3 capabilities allowing for 250kW charging rates, but also a 24-hour customer lounge with restrooms and a gift shop.\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\nTesla initially filed to expand the Kettleman City Supercharging station in late May 2021. Since the location is one of the most popular and also located near Tesla’s Fremont factory, where the company’s vehicles are produced, Tesla owners visit the site frequently to recharge their all-electric vehicles. However, 40 Supercharging stalls just did not seem to be doing the job, so Tesla filed to expand the site, and the construction is underway.\nNew photos from Tesla Motors Club forum member ElectricCyclist, who took several photographs of the ongoing progress of Kettleman City’s expansion. As seen in the pictures, the Superchargers are already placed. The next portion of the project appears to be excavation, asphalt, and line painting. It seems all of the relevant electrical work is already completed, so Tesla may be able to open the site before the end of the year if all goes well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKettleman City will be among the largest Supercharger stations in the world. The largest will be in Harris Ranch, California, with 100 stalls. There is also a massive 72-stall station in Shanghai and a 56-stall location in Firebaugh, California.\nTesla has had a plan to expand its footprint of V3 Superchargers for some time. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has even hinted that it will upgrade the V3 Superchargers to equip charging speeds of up to 300kW, which would give owners incredibly fast charging speeds. 250kW charge rates allow for up to 1,000 miles per hour of charging time.\nTesla currently has over 25,000 active Supercharger locations worldwide, with plenty more on the way. However, more charging options may be available in the coming years as evidence of an aggressive expansion has been noted on several occasions recently. In China, Tesla launched a dedicated V3 Supercharger production facility that would accelerate the rollout of the company’s fastest Superchargers as the Chinese market continues to adopt EVs.\nDon’t hesitate to contact us with tips!

      "description": "Tesla’s insane Model S Plaid active spoiler has been spotted at the Nürburgring racetrack in Germany. Tesla has been attempting to break its own lap record at the raceway, which it set on September 9th.\nTeslarati caught exclusive photos of the Model S Plaid’s active spoiler at the Ring earlier today. Tesla has been at the Nürburgring since August, testing and pushing the limits of the Model S Plaid, the world’s fastest production vehicle. CEO Elon Musk confirmed on September 9th that the Model S Plaid had officially broken the record at the track, nicknamed the Green Hell due to its treacherous course surrounded by thick forestry, with a time of 7:30.909. The vehicle used to set that time was unmodified and was shipped directly to Germany from Tesla’s Fremont factory.\n\nOn the Model S spotted by Teslarati earlier today is an active rear spoiler, which improves aerodynamic performance, including downforce in corners and speed. The spoiler can be adjusted to different angles, allowing the car to run with variable settings to see which would be best for a high-speed run.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\nTesla was testing three Model S Plaid units in total: Deep Blue Metallic with the active spoiler and one Red Multi-Coat and a Solid Black. The Red and Black Model S Plaids spotted at the track were not fitted with the active spoiler. Additionally, the Blue and Red Model S Plaid units were also equipped with drilled brakes, allowing harder and faster braking, fitting for a performance setting. Tesla is likely benchmarking the Model S Plaids against one another to see which modifications are providing the most improvements in speed, braking, downforce, and aerodynamics. This will give Tesla the most effective data in determining which settings will create the fastest car.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn typical Tesla fashion, the company is not satisfied with just holding a record. It is constantly looking to improve upon perfection, especially when some of the world’s most renowned automakers are frequently at the Nürburgring looking to break speed records and lap times. While the Model S Plaid in stock form holds the track record at the raceway, competitors will have an even more difficult time catching up to Tesla as it has brought modifications that could be a part of an aforementioned “Track Pack” to Germany to drive in its domination even further.\nTesla CEO Elon Musk stated just after the record-setting run at the Ring in September that the automaker would be modifying a Plaid Model S for future runs. Musk said, “Next will be modified Plaid with added aero surfaces, carbon brakes &amp; track tires (all things that can be done without Tesla being in the loop.” Musk was likely referring to the active spoiler and the noticeable front splitter when mentioning added aero surfaces. Brakes and track tires are also being equipped by Tesla here to improve performance.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Tesla active spoiler on the Model S Plaid was first spotted in May 2021 while the company was testing multiple vehicle units at the Laguna Seca Raceway in California.\nDon’t hesitate to contact us with tips!

      "description": "Image: @teslascope/Twitter\nTesla prepares to provide Dashcam Live Streaming for car owners, as mobile app source code hints. In addition, owners will be able to speak into the microphone of their mobile phone and project their voice through the external speaker of the vehicle.Tesla cars have always distinguished themselves in that they could provide additional protection. With external cameras and Sentry Mode, vehicles gain a unique level of protection, continuously monitoring their surroundings when left unattended. When enabled, Sentry Mode enters a “Standby” state, like many home alarm systems, which uses the car’s external cameras to detect potential threats. If a minimal threat is detected, such as someone leaning on a car, Sentry Mode switches to an “Alert” state and displays a message on the touchscreen warning that its cameras are recording. If a more severe threat is detected, such as someone breaking a window, Sentry Mode switches to an “Alarm” state, which activates the car alarm, increases the brightness of the center display, and plays music at maximum volume from the car's audio system.While such a feature is already a great addition in itself, Tesla decided to go even further and provide owners with the ability to watch video footage of the car in real-time. According to @teslascope/Twitter, Tesla is close to presenting the ability to watch video from its cars on owners' mobile devices in real-time, which was discovered in source code. It is reported that this feature may become available in vehicle software update 2021.40. It is not yet clear whether this feature will provide the ability to view footage only in Sentry Mode or receive a live feed from any of the vehicle's cameras.Another feature hidden in the source code is the ability to save the clip after watching it, which is very handy. At the moment, it remains unclear exactly where the clip will be saved—directly to a mobile device or to a car's USB drive.Apart from these already cool things, Tesla decided to provide owners with another awesome feature. According to the source code, the owners will have access to the transmission of their voice through the car speaker. The owner will be able to speak into the microphone of their mobile phone and project it through the car's external speaker. This can greatly help protect your vehicle if suspicious activity is seen near it. Unfortunately, Tesla cars sometimes fall prey to hater aggression. If the owner has access to live video and can say something to an attacker who is trying to harm the vehicle, then this can stop the aggressive behavior.\n\nDashcam Live Streaming is now CONFIRMED in addition to viewing Dashcam clips!You will also be able to speak directly via your mobile phone and project your voice via the PWS (Pedestrian Warning System). pic.twitter.com/g9DVRJVAB6\n— Teslascope (@teslascope) October 14, 2021\n\n\n\n© 2021, Eva Fox | Tesmanian.

      "description": "Tesla China has a new King EV, according to figures from the Chinese Passenger Car Association (CPCA). The Chinese entity responsible for tracking new vehicle registration has revealed the Model Y is officially the best-selling Tesla vehicle in China, overtaking the Model 3, which has been one of the biggest catalysts to the EV revolution in the country.\nThe Model Y is an all-electric crossover that entered the lineup of Tesla vehicles in March 2020 after initial production began. Since then, the vehicle has gained a massive amount of notoriety due to its widespread appeal in nearly every market that it is available in. In Tesla’s home state of California, the Model Y took only seven months to pass the sales figures of the Model 3. The two vehicles are extremely similar and share many of the same parts, up to 75%, according to some Tesla executives. The difference between the two cars really amounts to size, cargo space, and body style.\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\nWhile the Model Y has continued to establish its long-awaited title as Tesla’s most popular vehicle in general, the all-electric crossover is now overtaking the Model 3 in the Chinese automotive market. The Model 3 has performed exceptionally well in China since being delivered for the first time in the country nearly two years ago. It dominated sales figures for all of 2020, while 2021 has been friendly to the Model 3 as well. However, it has taken a backseat to the more affordable but less luxurious HongGuang Mini EV from GM’s conglomerate with Wuling and SAIC in China.\nTesla has still kept its eyes on the prize to deliver the highest quality electric vehicles in China. The Model Y has now overtaken the Model 3 in domestic sales, CPCA figures show. 33,033 Model Y units were sold in September alone, while 19,120 Model 3 builds were registered to new owners during Q3’s final month.\nThe surge of increasing Model Y sales can be attributed to Tesla’s appeal as an EV maker in China. Yesterday, the CPCA reported Tesla’s largest quarter in terms of deliveries in China, with 56,006 units.\n\nTesla China sold 19,120 Model 3 and 33,033 Model Y in September domestically. (CPCA)\n— Kelvin Yang (@KelvinYang7) October 13, 2021\n\n\nThe Model Y continues to dominate EV leaderboards globally, including the increasingly popular Chinese market that has contributed incredibly to the transition to electrification. CEO Elon Musk also has high hopes for the Model Y, stating that he expects the car to be the most popular vehicle in the world in 2022.\nDon’t hesitate to contact us with tips!

      "description": "Image: Visual Capitalist\nThere is a popular belief that word-of-mouth is the best advertisement. While traditional automakers continue to spend billions of dollars on advertising, Tesla is on the right track and instead invests that money in research and development (R&amp;D). Today, Tesla, among other automakers, spends the most on R&amp;D and the least on advertising per vehicle sold, while receiving exceptional word-of-mouth advertising.Investment in R&amp;D determines the future of the company, which has been proven for decades. Companies that are constantly evolving to provide consumers with the best products are always ahead of those that don't think about it. A great product and satisfied customers are the best advertising.Visual Capitalist surveyed the 2020 10-K filings of traditional automotive companies to see how much each of them spends on advertising and R&amp;D per vehicle produced. The results were astounding, as Tesla is the only manufacturer in the industry to spend $0 on advertising while nearly $3,000 on R&amp;D per vehicle.Marketing is usually a significant expense for most car manufacturers, however they are not as willing to spend money on R&amp;D. Tesla is now the only automaker to spend on average a whopping $2,984 per vehicle sold on R&amp;D, almost three times more than other traditional automakers. This amount is also almost equal to what the next three manufacturers spend together.In second place is Ford, which spends an average of $1,186 on R&amp;D for every car sold. In third place is Toyota, which spends $1,063. The fourth place is taken by GM with $878. Chrysler, which spends $784 on R&amp;D, closes out the top five. At the same time, these companies spend a lot of their funds on advertising.The average cost of advertising for traditional carmakers is $495 per vehicle. During this time, Tesla spends nothing on advertising, although its cars are so popular that they dominate in press mentions, social media, and are also used in films, TV shows, and other companies' advertisements. For example, several Tesla cars have recently appeared in new Pepsi advertisements.Balancing R&amp;D and advertising costs is part of the capital allocation, a decision that every business needs to make. R&amp;D can improve and enhance the quality of goods or services compared to competitors. If done correctly, it can lead to greater pricing, which will be reflected in profits. Advertising can spread information about products and promote a business without providing any benefit to improve the product itself.\n\nPer car sold, Tesla invests the most in research and development and the least in advertisingCustomers appreciate that pic.twitter.com/ahiIbLQZPS\n— Alex (@alex_avoigt) October 12, 2021\n\n\n© 2021, Eva Fox | Tesmanian.

      "title": "Tesla’s move to Texas labeled ‘betrayal’ of California, a way to escape paying taxes",
      "description": "Upon moving from Silicon Valley to Austin, Texas, critics and fans of Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk have mixed opinions about the move. Tesla enthusiasts might have seen it coming all along, especially after California politicians spewed profanities in the direction of the CEO, whose company has already provided an influx of employment opportunities to its new Texas market. However, without darkness, there would not be light, and there are plenty of people who are widely skeptical of Tesla’s recent decision to move its Headquarters to Austin from Fremont. However, the reasons for the move are being labeled as a betrayal of California and its workers, even though Tesla has no intentions to move any of its facilities out of the Golden State. Additionally, a commonly spread myth about all billionaires attempting to avoid paying taxes is also being thrown into the mix, further adding fuel to a fire that doesn’t really need to exist.\nA recent article from the San Antonio Express-News indicates that Musk and Tesla have betrayed its California workers who have built the electric automaker from a longshot success story to the most highly-valued car company on Earth. Despite the reasoning from the article’s author, which misses the point of Tesla’s move, the narrative that Elon Musk is some sort of evil super villain sitting in a large chair with excessive lumbar support sitting in a billionaire’s palace scheming new reasons to get ahead while squishing the “average Joe” seems to appear out of nowhere. Even though Musk’s entire vision was to help avert a climate crisis and revolutionize the automotive industry, some people still seem to be convinced he is a man with horrible intentions. Still, the South African-born CEO was essentially driven out of California by its own people of authority. They asked, he granted, and now Musk is still being painted as the bad guy.\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\nThe assumption that Musk is forcing Tesla and its several manufacturing plants, logistics facilities, design studios out of California and shoving them to the Lone Star State is a common misconception amongst those who genuinely believe his mission is to make money and avoid paying his fair share of taxes. The thing is: If Musk was someone with this sort of agenda, would he have sold many of his residences? Would he be living part-time in a $50,000 home in Starbase, Texas to help with SpaceX projects? Would he be making portions of the company’s Fremont facility in Northern California permanent? Probably not.\nMusk has responded to inquiries in the past about his taxes, stating that most of his net worth is tied up in Tesla stock. He pays taxes proportionate to his time in California and has never cashed a paycheck from Tesla, which is the state-required minimum payment. “It just ends up accumulating in a Tesla bank account somewhere,” he said to the New York Times several years ago.\nOn top of the other accusations made in the San Antonio Express-News piece, let’s not forget about Musk’s treatment from Lorena Gonzalez, a California State Assemblywoman who famously Tweeted “F*** Elon Musk” in May 2020. Musk evidently took the message as an invitation to test Tesla’s appreciation elsewhere, and Texas was more than willing to invite the electric automaker to establish its new base in Austin.\n\nMessage received\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 11, 2020\n\n\nBefore Musk is labeled a traitor and Tesla a medium of betrayal to California and its workers, let’s not forget that Telsa’s presence in California isn’t disappearing. Let’s not forget all that Tesla has contributed to the economy and environment in California. And let’s not forget that Musk was encouraged by California’s politicians to seek another place for work.\nDon’t hesitate to contact us with tips!

      "title": "Tesla inks new nickel supply deal, inches closer to 4680 battery cell mass production",
      "description": "Tesla’s goal of mass-producing its 4680 battery cells recently took a significant step forward on Wednesday, when New Caledonian miner Prony Resources announced that the EV maker had agreed to purchase 42,000 tonnes of nickel in a multi-year deal. Nickel is a key material that Tesla needs for its high-powered batteries, such as the 4680 cells that are currently in pilot production at the company’s Kato Road facility in Fremont, California. \n\n\n\nIn a statement, Prony noted that it is aiming to produce 44,000 tonnes of nickel by 2024, effectively doubling its estimated 2021 output. During a news conference, Antonin Beurrier, Prony’s chief executive, confirmed that Tesla is now the mining company’s largest client to date. While he did not specify any details of Prony’s deal with Tesla, Beurrier did state that the 42,000-tonne volume for the EV maker was indicative and could vary. \n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CEO added that Prony’s nickel supply agreement with Tesla had been negotiated by Swiss commodity trader Trafigura, a shareholder in the mining firm. The deal between Tesla and Prony was also signed last month. Interestingly enough, Tesla and Prony had already been associated even before their recently-announced nickel deal, as the electric car maker was an adviser on product and sustainability standards for the miner. \n\n\n\nProny is not alone in its role as a key nickel supplier for Tesla. Earlier this year, Tesla also signed a deal to acquire nickel from BHP’s operations in Australia. And considering Tesla’s goal of ramping its vehicle and energy storage production in the coming years, it would not be surprising if the company inks several more deals with other nickel suppliers in the near future. Tesla CEO Elon Musk, after all, has emphasized that nickel would be a key component for its long range vehicles’ batteries. \n\n\n\n“I’d just like to re-emphasize, any mining companies out there, please mine more nickel. Wherever you are in the world, please mine more nickel and don’t wait for nickel to go back to some high point that you experienced some five years ago. Go for efficiency and environmentally-friendly nickel mining at high volume. Tesla will give you a giant contract for a long period of time if you mine nickel efficiently and in an environmentally sensitive way,” Musk said during last year’s Battery Day event, which featured the official unveiling of the company’s custom 4680 cells. \n\n\n\nThe Tesla CEO has been consistent on his nickel stance. During the recently-held 2021 Annual Shareholder Meeting, for example, Musk reiterated that the company’s most demanding vehicles like the Cybertruck and Tesla Semi would be using a nickel-based cathode. The Tesla CEO also reiterated the notion that the company’s Standard Range vehicles and battery storage products will use cells fitted with an iron-based cathode. “What actually matters is the cathode. Our long-range vehicles use a nickel-based cathode. But for our Standard Range vehicles and stationary vehicles, we’re using iron-based cathode,” Musk said. \n\n\n\nDon’t hesitate to contact us with news tips.

      "title": "Lucid announces DreamDrive: a ‘user-friendly, future-ready’ Advanced Driver Assistance System",
      "description": "Lucid Group has announced the details of its Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS), DreamDrive, which it calls “the most technically sophisticated advanced driver-assistance system.” Lucid’s DreamDrive, which comes standard in the company’s top two trims of its Air sedan, employs up to 32 onboard sensors, a driver-monitoring system, and a user-friendly interface powered by onboard ethernet networking systems. The system is set to have new features and improvements delivered to it through a series of Over-the-Air updates.\n“DreamDrive Pro has been designed to grow in capability, thanks to our ability to deliver software over-the-air and key equipment already in place in the vehicle,” Lucid’s Senior Director of ADAS and Autonomous Driving, Dr. Eugene Lee, said. “Thanks to highly integrated hardware and software teams, Lucid has the ability to develop new functionality for DreamDrive Pro in-house. This can benefit every facet of the DreamDrive Pro experience, from the frequency of updates to the planned rollout of the Highway Pilot system for conditional automated driving on select roadways in the coming years.” \nLucid begins production of Air sedan, expects October for first deliveries\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\n\nA Sensor Suite That Can Detect What the Human Eye Cannot \n\nThe 32 onboard sensors that will feed data to the DreamDrive system will detect what the human eye can’t. Only the most trained eye will be able to spot the up to 32 sensors on the Air Dream and Grand Touring editions as they will be seamlessly integrated into the exterior of the sedan.\nLucid writes:\n“Comprising 14 visible-light cameras, five radar units, four surround view cameras, ultrasonic sensors throughout the vehicle exterior, and, for DreamDrive Pro, the first automotive installation of LIDAR in North America. This solid-state LIDAR sensor will deliver high-resolution data with an ultra-wide field of view. Together, these sensors enable DreamDrive to detect what a human driver cannot, and act as an invisible co-pilot to help drivers get to their destination safely.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Human-Machine Interface That’s About the Human \n\nLucid DreamDrive also will use its Surreal Sound from its 21-internal speaker system to deliver clear directional alerts that will enhance the safety and awareness of drivers. The use of the speakers to warn drivers with directional alerts will enhance features like Front and Rear Cross Traffic Protection and Autonomous Emergency Braking. Surround View Monitoring also will provide a 360-degree view of the car, helping maneuver tight parking spaces or streets.\n\nHighway Assist and Auto Park \n\nHighway Assist and Auto Park features will also help enhance DreamDrive’s versatility. Lucid writes regarding Highway Assist:\n“The Highway Assist group of features is designed to help drivers stay safe, while also making the Lucid Air even more delightful to drive. Highway Assist blends adaptive cruise control and lane centering control to help keep the Lucid Air right where it belongs on the freeway, at a safe distance from the vehicle ahead and other lanes. Traffic Jam Assist operates at speeds between 0 and 40 miles per hour, aiding in centering the vehicle when lane lines are occluded by close traffic. For vehicles equipped with DreamDrive Pro, further functions for Highway Assist are already in development.“\nOf course, drivers will be able to use Highway Assist when the driver is attentive, and this will be confirmed through a robust sophisticated driver monitoring system. “An infrared driver camera tracks head position, eye gaze, and blinking, while hands-off detection prompts the driver to return their hands to the steering wheel immediately,” the company’s press release states.\nAdditionally, an Auto Park feature will make putting the car in tight spots much easier. Identifiying parallel or perpendicular spots and easily parking in them makes the task of maneuvering a thing of the past. It will even turn the wheels toward or away from the curb when parking on a hill.\nA Robust Platform for Greater Capability in the Future\nAll of these features are great, but they wouldn’t be possible without the right platform. Lucid’s proprietary Ethernet Ring will enable four high-speed computer gateways – one at each corner of every vehicle – which will communicate with one another at lightning-fast speeds to result in high performance and hgih degrees of redudnancy for key ssytems like steering, braking, power, sensors, and more.\nWhat do you think?

      "title": "Tesla Giga Shanghai Sells 56K+ Vehicles in September, Reaches Production Capacity of 681K+ Units",
      "description": "Photo: @JayinShanghai/Twitter\nTesla Giga Shanghai increased production by 26% in September compared to the previous month, demonstrating strong growth in factory productivity. More than 56,000 vehicles were produced last month, 93% of which were sold in China. Thus, in September, Tesla reached a production capacity of 681,400 units per year.Tesla continues to ramp up production at its Chinese factory Giga Shanghai. In September, the manufacturer managed to increase production by 26% from last month to an impressive 56,006 vehicles. This also means that the factory was producing an average of 1,866 vehicles per day. Such data also indicates that Tesla reached a production capacity of 681,400 units per year, which happened in just less than two years from the start of the operations. This became a new, unprecedented record and a new milestone in the development of the company in China.According to the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA), out of 56,006 vehicles sold, 3,853 units were exported. This means that Tesla sold a staggering 52,153 Model 3 and Model Y in the local market. This also highlights the huge demand for the manufacturer's cars in China, which has been questioned by the company's critics.As Tesla CEO Elon Musk explained earlier, in the first and partially in the second month of each quarter, Giga Shanghai manufactures and delivers cars to overseas markets. This is due to the fact that the delivery takes a long time, so the cars must be dispatched well in advance. In the second month, the factory partially manufactures and ships cars to distant regions of China. In the third month of each quarter, Giga Shanghai is actively producing and shipping cars for the surrounding regions of China. Therefore, sales in China in every last month of the quarter are always significantly higher than in the first two.\n\nExactly. Giga Shanghai makes cars for export in first half of quarter, then cars for far away parts of China, then cars for nearby parts of China. Net result is a crazy wave of deliveries end of quarter. It is tough on our team, so we’re hoping to reduce the wave in Q4 &amp; Q1.\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 22, 2021\n\n\n\nAs expected, Model Y has become the undisputed top seller based on early observations of license plate registrations in China. Of the 52,153 vehicles sold, Model Y sales totaled an impressive 33,033 units and Model 3 sales totaled 19,120 units. Although the sales of Model 3 seem to be weaker, this is only against the background of the stunning sales of Model Y. In comparison, Chinese EV makers Nio and Xpeng delivered over 10,000 vehicles each last month. Volkswagen AG said it has sold only 10,126 ID. series vehicles in China in September.\n\n(BREAKING) Tesla China NumbersSeptember total number is 56,006 China-made cars increased 27% MoM - Tesla's wholesale sales of MIC Tesla in September were 56,006 units, up 27% month-on-month, compared with 44,264 units in Aug.

      "description": "Wedbush maintains a target price of $1,000 for Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), as the company has a clear direction for development. The factories of the manufacturer in Austin and Berlin are a \"major positive\", which should be decisive in 2022.Tesla shares continue to perform better following the announcement of production and delivery data for Q3 2021. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives rates the stock as Buy and believes it will soon be worth $1,000, which is his official price target.In his analysis, Ives does not focus on the global chip shortage or new self-driving features the company is rolling out, as this is not the most important thing in his view. The analyst focuses on manufacturing facilities and how they are the main key to Tesla's success. \"While the chip shortage has been a clear headwind for Tesla and the overall auto/tech industry, we believe building out manufacturing capacity globally remains a key to Musk &amp; Co. success in 2022 and beyond,\" wrote Ives in a Sunday research report.The semiconductor shortage will continue to affect all automakers, leading to a further three million vehicle cutbacks in production schedules in the fourth quarter, equal to about 13% of planned production. However, Tesla has handled the chip shortage significantly better than others in the industry. Tesla vehicle sales in the first nine months of 2021 increased almost 100% over 2020.\"Austin and Berlin set to expand Tesla capacity into 2022,\" added Ives calling the expansion a \"major positive.\" If the production ramp goes smoothly, Tesla might deliver 1.5 million vehicles in 2022, while Wall Street estimates around 1.3 millionApart from producing additional vehicles in Giga Berlin, Tesla can also increase its profit margins. Local delivery of cars -- serving Europe from a European plant -- should be cheaper than shipping cars from Shanghai -- as Tesla has been doing recently.\n\n© 2021, Eva Fox | Tesmanian.

      "title": "Tesla co-founder shares warning about OEM’s EV focus: “They haven’t really done the math fully”",
      "description": "Former Tesla CTO and co-founder JB Straubel recently shared some insights about the electric vehicle revolution and the focus of OEMs on pure electric cars. While conversing with startup investor Jason Calacanis’ in an episode of YouTube’s This Week in Startups, Straubel covered several topics, including Tesla’s early days, the importance of battery recycling, and how some OEMs’ alleged complete dedication to electric vehicles may not be very well thought out at all. \n\n\n\nAs noted by Straubel, Tesla was actually quite surprised that the Model S did not cause a substantial shift among OEMs to commit fully to battery-electric cars. The Model S was designed to be the best car, period, and for all intents and purposes, it did not disappoint. However, despite the rave reviews of the Model S and the vehicle proving that electric cars could be at the pinnacle of the auto sector, legacy automakers did not make a serious shift to EVs. \n\n\n\n\n\nJB Straubel thought all automakers would immediately copy the technology of Tesla Model S 2012 and Tesla had to move fast to carve out a nicheBut that didn't happen And here we are today, Tesla, still, the best and largest EV producer, by far, in the world@elonmusk @jason pic.twitter.com/fXuZBzsAch— First Principle Investor, Not CFA (@1stPrincipleInv) October 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\n\n\n\n\n“The Model S was such a different car. The Roadster was a technology validation. We proved that batteries could work, they could go on a car, they could be safe, they could do the range and acceleration. The S was a whole different thing. It was so good. We put so much effort into that. Elon was hell-bent on making it the best car on the road. And I think we really delivered on that at the time. It was phenomenal. \n\n\n\n“I’m still amazed at the skepticism there was. Even after delivering those, we kinda imagined, I imagined, that people would see this and go ‘Clearly this is the future. This is all gonna work.’ All the car companies are gonna copy this immediately, and we’ll have to go really fast to figure out how we can carve out a niche. And it just didn’t happen. Customers loved it. It was a runaway hit with reviewers and magazines and customers, but the copying and market change didn’t happen,” Straubel said. \n\n\n\nThe automotive landscape today is different, however. With Tesla now the most valuable automaker by market cap and with Chinese car companies aggressively coming up with modern electric cars, OEMs have now adopted the narrative that they are going all-in on EVs. Straubel, however, noted that these announcements might not necessarily be realistic. \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat JB Straubel has to say about so many OEMs announcing their plans to go fully into EV\"They haven't, I think, really done the math fully?\"@elonmusk @jason pic.twitter.com/5iMpzIV1HD— First Principle Investor, Not CFA (@1stPrincipleInv) October 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“So many different OEMs, countries, factories, customers are leaping into EVs. You know, making these huge announcements, you know, saying that they’ll be fully electric this decade or the next. They haven’t, I don’t think they’ve done the math fully. What that entails on the supply chain and tracing it all the way back, literally all the way back to the mines. You need to do that, or else, you know, you haven’t really solved it. It has the feeling to me of kind of like a giant overbooked flight.  \n\n\n\n“All these people like, ‘Oh, this is great. We’re all gonna go to that new place. We all wanna go there. It looks great. Sweet. Let’s all go on the plane and go.’ So everybody’s saying that we all wanna go there at the same time. Meanwhile, we have to sort of build the planes to get there; we have to figure out how to sequence everyone. The figurative runway is like the time to do all this, and it could all get sorted out over time. But obviously, we’re trying to do this fast as a society and as a species,” Straubel said. \n\n\n\nWatch Straubel’s full interview with Jason Calacanis’ This Week in Startups in the video below. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon’t hesitate to contact us with news tips.
