The EVs are expected to be delivered in 2022 and help the city save thousands of dollars over traditional ICE vehicles.In September 2021, the Paragould City Council approved the purchase of two Tesla Model 3 vehicles for use in the Police Department fleet. It is estimated that these vehicles will save the city more than $7,400 a year in reduced fuel and maintenance costs. Thus, in just five years, they will bring savings of $37,000, compared to gas police vehicles.The main purpose of the purchase is the desire to reduce costs on fueling the vehicles. Captain Brad Snyder says that projections show a real opportunity, according to KAIT8. “We are expected to see about a 4,000 dollars a year savings in Tesla vs. the normal traditional gas units,” he said.The electric cars will be put through a pilot program where if they do not work as traffic unit vehicles they will be moved to another division. However, the experience of using Tesla vehicles by other police units in the United States has shown that the electric vehicles of the Texas manufacturer do an excellent job of their tasks, having even higher performance than originally expected.\n\n© 2021, Eva Fox | Tesmanian.

According to the report, Mercedes-Benz accumulated 213,708 vehicle registrations through Q3 2021, a hefty figure for the German automaker which has been battling supply chain bottlenecks and parts shortages through most of the year. However, other automakers are not immune to the issues as well, and a majority of car companies have been battling with semiconductor and other essential parts shortages for the better part of 2021.\nThat did not stop a small-but-mighty car company from Silicon Valley from overtaking German giant Mercedes from the third spot on the list. Tesla handily made its way past Mercedes-Benz with 230,855 registrations, becoming the third-best-selling luxury car brand in the routinely touted U.S. sector where luxury vehicles make up about 5% of the market.\n\n\n\nCredit: Tesla\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\nTesla is not far off of other high-end brands, as leaders BMW and Lexus held leads over the electric car company but not by many vehicles. BMW reached 259,237 registrations to take first prize, while Japanese Lexus came in second with 245,864 units.\nTesla very well may take over the top spot in the luxury sector by the end of the year. The company’s increasingly active production lines at the Fremont facility where its U.S. cars are built, along with the ongoing construction and imminent arrival of Gigafactory Texas manufacturing lines are both indicative of a scrappy and hungry car company that is preparing for an influx of customer orders for the next several years.\nMany of Tesla’s U.S. vehicles are sold out for 2021, and delivery times are indicating to customers that they may be waiting for several months in 2022 to receive their vehicles. While the new Tesla factory located just outside of Austin is expected to begin production in limited volumes by the end of the year, executives are looking toward 2022. Tesla CFO Zachary Kirkhorn said during the company’s Q3 2021 Earnings Call that “we [Tesla] should not expect for us to deliver cars by the end of 2021 from these factories [Texas and Berlin] even if we do produce them — so homologation, regulatory reasons.”\nHowever, it is not all bad for Tesla, even if Giga Texas does not begin shipping cars to patiently-waiting customers by the end of 2021. With increased production capacity and industry-leading gross margins, Tesla is making money hand over fist while balancing an evergrowing production sheet that continues to show the arrival of the electric revolution is upon the U.S. automotive sector.\nI’d love to hear from you!

This would make Rivian the sixth-most valuable automaker globally, displacing General Motors with a market cap of $85.92 billion. Rivian would be slightly behind Daimler, which holds a valuation of $109.12 billion.\nEarlier this week, Rivian priced its shares for its IPO at between $75 and $78, above its previously expected range. The automaker expected to raise $11.9 billion, making it the second-largest tech IPO of all time, trailing Facebook who raised $16 billion in May 2012.\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\nRivian’s valuation may be driven by the sentiment trailing its name, which is backed by high-end and well-known investors like Amazon and Ford. During a disclosure earlier this month, Amazon disclosed its 20% ownership position in Rivian, which will produce 100,000 all-electric e-commerce delivery vehicles for the company. The Rivian delivery vans have already been tested in various cities across the United States. The 100,000 deliveries will take place by 2030, with 10,000 units operating by the end of 2022.\nAmazon has a massive stake in Rivian, SEC filing shows\n\nRivian is entering an EV market that is becoming more populated with every quarter. Both existing, legacy automotive companies and new, tech-focused startups are attempting to establish new EVs that will dethrone the undisputed king of the sector, Tesla. Rivian, while delivering around 150 units of its introductory R1T as of November 1, is the first automaker to introduce an all-electric pickup to the market. It will have tough competition to fend off as Ford will roll out the F-150 Lightning in Spring 2022. GMC’s Hummer EV is expected to begin deliveries later this year, and the widely-popular Tesla Cybertruck is set to start production in late 2022.\n150,000 all-electric vehicles are expected to roll off Rivian’s production lines at its manufacturing facility in Normal, Illinois, annually. Along with the R1T and Amazon delivery vans, Rivian is developing the R1S, an all-electric SUV that could begin deliveries as soon as December, the company’s prospectus said. Rivian also stated that it has 9,500 employees, with over 3,400 of them working at the Normal Factory.\nRivian will have an uphill battle for the remainder of 2021, as it said in the October prospectus. Revenue has not been generated due to its process of ramping current vehicle production, which is costly and challenging to scale. Tesla CEO Elon Musk advised Rivian to ramp and solve production at its single Normal, Illinois factory for the time being. However, rumors of a manufacturing expansion known as “Project Terra” have swirled through the sector, with several U.S. states, including Texas, being discussed as a possible landing spot for Rivian’s second production plant.\nDisclosure: Joey Klender is not a RIVN Shareholder.\nI’d love to hear from you!

And while the company also brought over some of its luxury SUVs to Times Square, it was the Model 3 that evidently took the center stage.

Since announcing its intention to purchase 100,000 Teslas from the American electric car maker, Hertz has gone ahead and featured the Model 3 in several of its advertisements. This was despite Tesla CEO Elon Musk noting on Twitter that the Hertz deal involves no fleet discounts for the car rental company. \n\n\n\nIn a recent appearance at CNBC’s Squawk Box, Hertz Board Member Tom Wagner highlighted that there is no doubt that demand far outstrips Tesla’s supply. He also noted that Hertz has been seeing some interest for electric vehicles among its customers. “There’s no question demand exceeds supply at Tesla, there’s enormous built up demand from us, from consumers in general … It’s really about working to ensure we bring vehicles into the fleet in timeline consistent with what all parties want,” Wagner said. \n\n\n\n\n\nHertz: “There’s no question demand exceeds supply at Tesla, there’s enormous built up demand from us, from consumers in general … It’s really about working to ensure we bring vehicles into the fleet in timeline consistent with what all parties want” $TSLA pic.twitter.com/azD3kM5McG— Tesla New York (@TeslaNY) November 9, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Hertz may have no binding contract for its massive 100,000 Tesla purchase, the EV maker did benefit from news of the car rental giant’s order. The massive vehicle order helped Tesla stock strengthen its momentum, which ultimately pushed Tesla well into a valuation of over $1 trillion. Hertz also seems to be looking at a long-term relationship with Tesla.

The market launch of an affordable electric car from Tesla will determine the further development of the global automotive market, as many people will prefer an environmentally friendly EV rather than an ICE car that pollutes the environment with exhaust gases. The company's VP in China expects the market launch of a new affordable Tesla model already in the near future.During the 4th China International Import Expo, Tesla China VP Grace Tao said that in the near future, the market will be able to see cars independently designed and manufactured by the Chinese team on the country's roads, according to The Paper. The fact that Tesla’s executive in China began to speak openly about this may indicate that the company is not far from completing the project.\n\n\"I hope that in the near future, not only will Chinese-made models reach nearly 100% localized productivity, but we may also be able to witness models completely independently designed and manufactured by the Chinese team driving on Chinese roads. Next, we will continue to strengthen our technical cooperation with domestic industry chain partners and will increase the localization rate of the supply chain, and at the same time promote the integration of Tesla and China's local economy to achieve common development.\"\n\nIn early 2021, before the start of the Giga Shanghai expansion, Tesla received approval for an environmental impact report from the Lingang Area Development and Construction Management Committee. The project will carry out tests related to the launch of a new model and research work at the existing plant, including testing of important equipment and manufacturing processes. According to the document, the testing cycle is about six months for verification, and coordination of parts and functions, etc.In early January 2021, Tesmanian reported that in September 2020, according to rumors, Tesla had already developed a new car model, and would soon be ready to start production at its Giga Shanghai. The affordable compact car was expected to be produced and delivered in 2022. If we combine the known facts and some rumors, then Tao's statement confirms the guesses, and the market may indeed soon get an affordable electric car from Tesla.\n\n© 2021, Eva Fox | Tesmanian.

Although it is a four-door electric vehicle capable of seating up to 7 people, Model S Plaid is also the first production car ever to hit 60 mph in less than 2 seconds and sprint a 1/4 mile in just 8.994 seconds, setting a new world record.In mid-May, Tesla Model S Plaid had set a new 1/4 mile speed record for any production vehicle in the world. The record of 9.247 seconds with a trap speed of 152.16mph was set on May 11, 2021, at the Autoclub Famoso Raceway in Bakersfield. Jay Leno, who was there at the time, confirmed that the Model S Plaid set a new 1/4 mile record of 9.247 seconds.However, this is not the limit of what this electric horse can produce and a new 1/4 mile time record was recently set. Tom Tharp/Twitter shared the news that his friend's family was able to set a new record. According to the post, his friend George and his wife Christine ran the 1/4 mile in their Tesla Model S Plaid in less than 9 seconds. A photo of the recorded run time showed that the distance was covered in 8.994 seconds. According to the video shared by Tom, the trap speed was 155mph.\n\nCongratulations to my friend George and his wife Christine! They ran the first 8 second 1/4 mile in their Tesla Plaid Model S! pic.twitter.com/xjTJD6jQra\n— Tom Tharp (@tomtharp) November 8, 2021\n\n\nAlthough there is no description of how the Model S Plaid was modified, the photo shows that it was lightened by removing the seats. Other details of the modifications remain unknown.What is clear at this point is that the Tesla Model S Plaid has already broken the 9.4 second 1/4 mile record set by the $3.3 million Bugatti Chiron Sport. Thus, the family electric car, which costs 27 times (!!!) less than the Bugatti Chiron Sport, is the fastest production car in the world.\n\n© 2021, Eva Fox | Tesmanian.

Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and J.P. Morgan currently stand as Rivian’s underwriters for the company’s debut. And based on filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Rivian is looking to enter the public markets in a big way — and it is setting its ambitions very high. \n\n\n\nTarget Valuation\n\n\n\nRivian has disclosed that it is targeting a valuation above $65 billion in its IPO, with shares priced between $72 and $74. Such a valuation is ambitious, as it would make Rivian’s market cap just a bit lower than veterans such as General Motors ($84.82 billion) and Ford Motor Company ($79.65 billion), the latter being a key investor in the truck maker. Similar to fellow electric vehicle maker Tesla, which currently reached a market cap above of over $1 trillion, Rivian’s valuation target is founded on the idea that the company may see a meteoric rise in the coming years. \n\n\n\n(Credit: Rivian)\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\n\n\n\nIf Rivian’s shares end up selling at the top of their marketed range, the company could make history as the seventh-biggest US IPO on record, according to Bloomberg. It would also overtake longtime players in the auto segment, such as Japanese carmakers Honda Motor Co., which has a market cap of $53 billion, and French automaker Renault SA, which is valued at a conservative $11 billion. \n\n\n\nThe Finances So Far\n\n\n\nRivian’s S-1 filing with the SEC has provided a glimpse of the company’s finances so far. Just as expected, and similar to fellow electric vehicle makers that are just starting out, Rivian is currently burning cash, with heavy investments in R&amp;D and high operating costs. This is likely due to the fact that the company is still learning the ropes when it comes to mass-producing its three vehicle offerings, one of which has an order for 100,000 units from Amazon, the world’s premier e-commerce site. \n\n\n\nRivian currently employs over 8,000 people across multiple facilities in Arizona, California, Michigan, Illinois, Vancouver, Canada, and the UK. And as the company approached the production of the R1T pickup truck and R1S SUV, its losses grew. Rivian posted a net loss of $994 million from January to June 2021, more than double the $377 million net loss it posted for the first half of 2020. Rivian’s R&amp;D expenses are also on the rise, with the company spending $683 million in Q1 and Q2 2021. In comparison, its R&amp;D cost for 2020 stood at $766 million. Despite this, Rivian still has about $3.6 billion in cash on its balance sheet. \n\n\n\n(Credit: Rivian Stories)\n\n\n\nWhat Analysts are Saying\n\n\n\nRivian is quite unique among EV startups today because its already has a sure customer in Amazon, which has ordered 100,000 units of an all-electric delivery van. That being said, New Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu stated in a note on Monday that Rivian may end up facing a “natural ceiling” of 300,000 to 400,000 units per year, partly due to the price range of its consumer vehicles, the R1T pickup truck and the R1S SUV. The R1T currently starts at $67,500 for its base model, while the R1S starts at $70,000. \n\n\n\n“Above $70,000, the global addressable market for Rivian’s SUV and pickup is less than 1.5 million units, and it will be a crowded space,” Ferragu wrote. \n\n\n\nIvan Drury, a senior analyst at Edmunds, highlighted that Rivian may face an uphill climb when ramping its first vehicles, especially considering that the chip crisis is still ongoing. “It’s difficult enough for established automakers, let alone a new one. Couple that with this new issue the entire industry is dealing with, the chip crisis, that just adds another layer of complexity,” Drury noted. \n\n\n\nRivian’s Production Plans\n\n\n\nRecent reports have noted that Rivian is currently focusing its resources on delivering the first batch of its Amazon delivery vans. This makes sense considering the volume of orders it has received from the e-commerce giant, but this strategy could also result in the R1T and R1S being ramped at a more deliberate pace. So far, Rivian has noted that it has received just over 55,000 pre-orders for the R1T and R1S. And since starting deliveries of the R1T, the company has only delivered 156 units of the all-electric pickup truck, “nearly all” of them to Rivian employees. \n\n\n\nRivian’s SEC filing has provided a bit more detail about the R1T and R1S’ rather deliberate ramp. According to the document, the company expects to fill its pre-order backlog of approximately 55,400 R1 vehicles by the end of 2023. Previous reports also note that Rivian is expected to deliver the first 10,000 units of its Amazon delivery vans by the end of 2022, with the entire 100,000-unit order being completed by the end of the decade. \n\n\n\n(Credit: eHauler/RivianForum)\n\n\n\nLegal Challenges to Date\n\n\n\nSimilar to other automakers, Rivian is also involved in some legal challenges. Among the more notable ones involve fellow EV maker Tesla, which has filed a suit against Rivian last year over the alleged theft of intellectual property related to recruitment, bonus and compensation plans for sales personnel, and manufacturing project management systems. A later lawsuit from Tesla also alleged that the truck maker was acquiring core technology related to its upcoming 4680 cells, which was deemed by the Silicon Valley-based company as the “most essential element for any electric vehicle.” \n\n\n\nMore recently, Laura Schwab, who was the first female President in luxury automaker Aston Martin’s history, also filed a suit against Rivian over alleged gender discrimination. Schwab served as Rivian’s Vice President of Sales and Marketing during her tenure with the company. But according to the former Rivian executive, she was routinely excluded from meetings despite her experience in the auto industry, and her warnings about the R1T and R1S’ pricing and public targets were largely ignored. Finally, Schwab noted that she was terminated by Rivian just before it went public, which effectively made her lose “millions of dollars in unvested equity on the eve of the company’s IPO.”\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nWith electric vehicle maker Tesla joining the trillion-dollar club, numerous investors are now looking towards the “next Tesla.” And while not all EV startups have succeeded — hydrogen truck company Nikola is a good cautionary tale — companies like Rivian and Lucid Motors do seem to have the makings of a legitimate, and potentially profitable long-term business. This was something highlighted by Pitchbook senior mobility analyst Asad Hussain, who noted that “Rivian’s premium market valuation reflects its ownership of the entire value chain and freedom to innovate without dealing with stranded assets. Between Rivian and Lucid, the market finally has credible candidates for ‘the next Tesla.” \n\n\n\nWould you consider investing in Rivian?

The company aspires to become the state's electricity supplier out of a desire to improve the overall state of affairs in the state's energy market, which deteriorated following a winter storm in February 2021.Tesla demonstrated its intention to sell electricity directly to consumers in Texas by filing an application with the Texas Public Utility Commission in August. At the end of last week, the state issued a permit, according to Gizmodo. The commission wrote that Tesla Energy Ventures is now licensed to “provide retail electric services throughout the area served by ERCOT,” which is basically all of Texas.In February, winter storms hit Texas and left millions of people without electricity for several days. Tesla CEO Elon Musk was one of those impacted, as he and his family were there. Also, the construction of Giga Texas was stopped for several days. The company became one of those who helped the local population by donating and delivering food and essentials. All of this likely prompted the company to help the state bolster its energy market. At the moment, there are no details regarding Tesla's alleged activities there, but the company has experience in this area.“Usually an electricity service provider that doesn't have generation on the ground essentially acts as a middleman, they buy on the wholesale market and turn around and sell to customers,” Ted Kury, director of energy studies for the Public Utility Research Center at the University of Florida, told UtilityDive at the time of the Tesla filing. “Tesla would have the ability to act as a buyer and seller simultaneously and have access to a lot of data. Regulators are going to have to think about what the implications might be.\"\n\n© 2021, Eva Fox | Tesmanian. All rights reserved.\n\n_____________________________\nWe appreciate your readership!

The company plans to sell only fully electric cars by 2030 and aims to be a climate-neutral and circular business by 2040.\n\n\n\nBy using sustainable materials inside the car, equipping it with tires from recycled and renewable material, improving aerodynamics, and through other measures, Volvo Cars can take huge steps to reduce its carbon impact through the car itself.\n\n\n\nWhen combining those steps with the use of clean energy throughout a decarbonized supply chain, manufacturing process, and use phase of the car, Volvo Cars believes it can reduce a car’s lifecycle CO2 impact by 80 percent versus a 2018 Volvo XC60, without losing the inherent premium qualities that Volvo cars have become known for.\n\n\n\nThis would mean that the Concept Recharge would have an overall life cycle CO2 impact below 10 tonnes when charged with 100 percent renewable energy.\n\n\n\n“As we enter the age of the electric car, how far you can drive on a full charge will be a key consideration,” said Owen Ready, Head of Strategic and Brand Design at Volvo Cars. “The easy approach is to add more batteries, but it is not the same as simply adding a bigger fuel tank today – batteries add weight and increase the carbon footprint. Instead, we have to increase overall efficiency to increase range. With Concept Recharge, we explore the tension between the need for efficiency and the desire for the same space, convenience, and driving experience as in today’s SUVs.”\n\n\n\nVolvo Cars is at the forefront when it comes to working with sustainable and natural materials in its cars, and the Concept Recharge is another proof point of its commitment to push forward with this ambition.\n\n\n\nVolvo Concept Recharge, Interior seats\n\n\n\nThe interior design is rich in sustainable materials, both natural and recycled materials – think of responsibly sourced Swedish wool, environmentally responsible textiles, and lightweight composites created from natural sources.\n\n\n\nResponsibly sourced Swedish wool is transformed into fully natural breathable cloth, free from additives. This warm and soft material is used in the seat backrest and instrument panel top. Meanwhile, the floor and lower doors are covered by a rich carpet of 100 percent wool.\n\n\n\nThe seat cushions and touch surfaces on the door are made from an environmentally responsible material that contains Tencel™ fibers from cellulose. This fabric has great durable strength and is soft to the skin. By using Tencel fibers, which have been produced through high water- and energy-efficient processes, Volvo designers can reduce the use of plastics in interior parts.\n\n\n\nThe seatbacks and headrests, as well as part of the steering wheel, use a new material created by Volvo Cars called Nordico. It is a soft material made from bio-based and recycled ingredients that come from sustainable forests in Sweden and Finland, providing a CO2 footprint that is 74 percent lower than leather.\n\n\n\nElsewhere in the interior, including in the lower storage areas, back of the headrest, and the footrest, the Concept Recharge uses a flax composite, developed by Volvo Cars in collaboration with suppliers. It uses fibers from the linseed plant, which are mixed with composites to provide a strong and lightweight, yet attractive and natural aesthetic.\n\n\n\nOn the exterior, the front and rear bumpers as well as the sill moldings also consist of flax composite. Using a flax composite both inside and out in this way results in a significant reduction of plastics used.\n\n\n\n“With the Concept Recharge, we’ve created a comfortable and functional family space,” said Lisa Reeves, Head of Interior Design. “The cabin offers sophisticated forms through the use of natural materials and the harmonization of textures and tones, reflecting the timeless elegance of premium Scandinavian design.”\n\n\n\nWith the internal combustion engine making way for the pure electric powertrain, tires play an even more important role. Not only are they crucial for safety, but they also contribute largely to the vehicle’s battery range. This means tires for electric cars always have to be on top of technology development.\n\n\n\nHence the Concept Recharge features special tires made by Pirelli, which are completely free from mineral oil and are made from 94 percent fossil-free materials, including recycled and renewable materials like natural rubber, bio-silica, rayon, and bio-resin. This reflects the circular approach shared by Volvo Cars and Pirelli, with a focus on reducing resource consumption and environmental impact.\n\n\n\nBeyond its sustainable materials, electric powertrain, and special tires, Concept Recharge also improves the environmental credibility of SUVs through efficiency and aerodynamics.\n\n\n\nWith the Concept Recharge, Volvo Cars envision the future of aerodynamics. It incorporates innovative aerodynamic features such as exterior design details that smooth the airflow, a new wheel design, a lower roof, and a more upright rear end.\n\n\n\nAs such, it takes the classic SUV shape and improves airflow to increase range, while offering the incredible space opportunities that come naturally with an electric car and its lower floor.\n\n\n\n“While consumers continue to drive demand for the benefits of SUVs, we are determined to produce cars that offer all the safety and comfort they look for, as well as slash their environmental impact,” said Owen Ready.\n\n\n\nSource\nThe post The Concept Recharge visualizes Volvo Cars’ path towards sustainable mobility appeared first on The EV Report.","author":"The EV Report","url":"https://theevreport.com/the-concept-recharge-visualizes-volvo-cars-path-towards-sustainable-mobility","link_type":"article","item_date":1637157691000,"item_id":"35145cb6","timestamp":1637519497383,"domain":"theevreport.com","item_date_formatted":"Nov 17","description_trimmed":"Labeled a manifesto for Volvo Cars’ future, the pure electric Concept Recharge does much more than showcase the company’s future design language and product strategy.\n\n\n\nWith the Concept Recharge, Volvo Cars demonstrate the steps it will take in all areas of pure electric car dev...","keywords":"Concept Recharge, Volvo Cars, Flax Composite, Electric Car"},{"title":"General expenses of owning a Tesla in the UK?","description":"Update: Just as there was some confusion about my salary!

It also marks the first time that MotorTrend has given the title to a carmaker's inaugural product. Lucid Air Dream Editions.LucidLucid, founded in 2007 and run by former Tesla chief engineer Peter Rawlinson, began delivering the Air to customers in late October. It's a luxurious, high-tech sedan with industry-topping range. It's primed to become a formidable rival to the Tesla Model S, provided Lucid can rapidly scale up production and roll out cheaper versions of the Air, including a $77,400 base model. The debut version of the Air, the $169,000 Dream Edition, impressed MotorTrend's panelists across six criteria: engineering excellence, efficiency, advancement in design, performance of intended function, safety, and value. \"With the longest driving range of any electric vehicle on the market, an EPA-estimated 520 miles, and over 1,100 horsepower available, the Lucid Air is a technological tour de force,\" MotorTrend Group's head of editorial, Ed Loh, said. \"The sleek futuristic Lucid Air sedan looks like nothing else on the road, while its gorgeous, smartly-packaged interior sets the standard for the next generation of luxury cars.\"The Lucid Air Dream Edition interior.LucidThe Air is the third electric vehicle to win Car of the Year.

The brand is expected to be operating in 30 markets by the end of 2023 as it is looking to ramp up sales to 290,000 vehicles by the end of 2025.\n\n\n\n“We have driven tremendous growth since beginning full-scale activity in 2020, underpinned by organic market expansion, strong interest in our award-winning Polestar models and benefits from post-pandemic retail tailwinds,” says Thomas Ingenlath, Polestar CEO. “We look forward to further accelerating growth by expanding our global presence and continuing to innovate our product portfolio.”\n\n\n\nPolestar began the full-scale activity with 10 global markets in 2020 and is on the road in 14 markets today. Market expansion continues and in the first half of 2022, Spain, Portugal and Ireland are planned to be added to the European market footprint, with Israel planning to expand its presence in the Middle East.\n\n\n\nThe expansion of Polestar’s global retail presence has also picked up. A total of 86 Polestar retail locations are now open globally, up from 40 at the end of 2020. These Polestar retail locations include downtown Polestar Spaces, easily accessible out-of-town Polestar Destinations and Polestar test drive centers. The latest additions include facilities in New York City and Boston in the U.S., where, after a surge of new openings, a total of 25 facilities are expected to be in operation by the end of 2021.\n\n\n\nPolestar has also seen an increase in interest attributed to the launch of the critically acclaimed Polestar 2, which has seen over 110,000 test drives completed and more than 50 awards to date. More than two million people have visited Polestar retail locations since the start of deliveries in August 2020.\n\n\n\n“New markets and growth in our existing markets underpin our near-term volume ambitions,” continues Thomas Ingenlath. “Longer-term, this expansion will be fueled by our plan to launch a new car every year for the next three years. These are the foundations of our rapid growth strategy.”\n\n\n\nWith the expansion into existing and new markets and the planned arrival of three new products, the company aims to increase its annual sales to 290,000 vehicles by the end of 2025.\n\n\n\nAbout\n\n\n\nPolestar was established as a new, standalone Swedish premium electric vehicle manufacturer in 2017. Founded by Volvo Cars and Geely Holding, Polestar enjoys specific technological and engineering synergies with Volvo Cars and benefits from significant economies of scale as a result.\n\n\n\nThe company is headquartered in Gothenburg, Sweden, and its vehicles are currently available and on the road in 14 global markets across Europe, North America and China. In 2021, it is expanding into eight additional new markets in Europe, the middle East and Asia Pacific. Polestar cars are currently manufactured in two facilities in China, with additional future manufacturing planned in the U.S.\n\n\n\nSource\nThe post Polestar Continues Aggressive Global Expansion appeared first on The EV Report.","author":"The EV Report","url":"https://theevreport.com/polestar-continues-aggressive-global-expansion","link_type":"article","item_date":1636986655000,"item_id":"bc31a5c9","timestamp":1637519497253,"domain":"theevreport.com","item_date_formatted":"Nov 15","description_trimmed":"Rapid physical sales footprint expansion; 46 new retail locations in 2021, of which 20 in United States\n\n\n\nGothenburg – Polestar continues to deliver on its market and retail expansion plans that underpin significant growth targets over the coming years.
