      "description": "The Tesla Model Y is sold out in the United States for the rest of 2021, revealing strong demand for the all-electric crossover.\n\n\n\nA quick search on Tesla’s US order page reveals that the estimated delivery date for a Model Y Performance is now January 2022. The expected delivery date for a Model Y Long Range is even later, on June 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\n\n\n\nTesla recently increased the price of the Model Y and the Model 3 by $1,000. The Model Y Long Range now costs $57,990 before options. The Performance variant starts at $62,990 before options. Tesla is also offering a new free paint option, called Midnight Silver Metallic, along with Pearl White Multi-coat.\n\n\n\nRecent videos of the Fremont Factory and Giga Shanghai revealed how busy Tesla is this quarter with deliveries. Tesla’s first factory in California seems filled to the brim with vehicles waiting to be delivered. Giga Shanghai also seemed busy, with its holding lot bursting with cars.\n\n\n\nIn China, the Model Y Standard Range Plus seems to be selling out fast, too. The estimated delivery date for the MIC Model Y SR+ is 6-10 weeks, either around late December 2021 to early January 2022. The MIC Model Y Long Range and Performance variants’ expected delivery dates are listed as “the fourth quarter.”\n\n\n\n\nTesla Q4 deliveries teased with 12 export ships to Asia and Europe\n\n\n\n\n\nTesla hopes to make the Model Y the best-selling vehicle of any kind in the world by either next year or 2023.\n\n\n\n“As we’ve mentioned before, we’ve seen record growth of both Model 3 and Model Y segments, where Model 3 is currently the best-selling luxury sedan worldwide. And as we mentioned at our shareholders’ meeting, Model Y is poised to be the best-selling vehicle in the world,” said Lars Moravy, Tesla’s VP of Vehicle Engineering, at the last earnings call.\n\n\n\nTesla Giga Texas and Giga Berlin are expected to significantly contribute to the company’s goals for the Model Y. The two new Tesla gigafactories are expected to start operations with Model Y production lines. Tesla aims to produce Model Y vehicles with structural battery packs and 4680 cells at Giga Texas and Giga Berlin.\n\n\n\nThe Teslarati team would appreciate hearing from you.

      "description": "Image: @greentheonly/Twitter\nTesla has begun rolling out a new software update that brings cold weather improvements, active noise reduction, TIDAL, and much more. The updates should significantly improve the experience of using its cars and make them even more user-friendly.Tesla recently began rolling out the new software, 2021.40, which has many interesting features that will undoubtedly make the user experience more enjoyable. The company has introduced a new TIDAL music streaming option so that owners can enjoy quality sound from the high-end audio systems installed in their vehicles. TIDAL is a Norwegian music, podcast, and video subscription streaming service recently acquired by Jack Dorsey's Square. Although it has fewer subscribers than other popular similar services, TIDAL offers original content and carefully curated playlists with over 70 million tracks and 250,000 music videos.\n\nTIDAL\nTIDAL streaming is now available from the Media menu with a TIDAL account. You can listen to TIDAL playlists or albums in high-quality audio by connecting to Wi-Fi and pressing Download on the selected content.\n\nThe software update also brings improved vehicle performance in cold weather. Tesla has optimized automatic battery pre-conditioning to consume less energy. In addition, you can now enable front defrost and maintain your climate settings when clearing ice and snow.\n\nCold Weather Improvements\nYou can now enable front defrost and maintain your climate settings when clearing ice and snow. As usual, tap the fan icon and select Keep Climate On when parked.Additionally, when using climate controls on the Tesla App, automatic battery pre-conditioning has been optimized to consume less energy.\n\nThe updated Model S and Model X have added Active Road Noise Reduction, which uses new microphones to enable active noise canceling.\n\nActive Road Noise Reduction\nYour vehicle now has the ability to actively reduce low-frequency road noise while driving on rough surfaces. To accomplish this, the system uses the seat microphones to measure the noise in the cabin, then generates anti-noise through the speakers to create quiet zones around the occupants.To access, tap Audio Settings &gt; Options &gt; Active Road Noise Reduction.\n\nTraffic Aware Cruise Control Chime, which was previously launched in China, will now also be added to its cars. When Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is activated, the car beeps, which was done in order to warn drivers if they accidentally activated TACC.\n\nTraffic Aware Cruise Control Chime\nYou will now receive an audio alert when Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is enabled. To disable, tap Controls&gt; Autopilot&gt; Traffic-Aware Cruise Control Chime.\n\nIn addition, Tesla added “British English” as an official language.\n\nNew Language Support\nYou can now select British English as your language. To update your language setting, tap Controls &gt; Display and select the desired option from the Language drop down menu.\n\n\n2021.40 Tesla Release Notes via Not a Tesla App\n© 2021, Eva Fox | Tesmanian.

Later in the week, Hertz confirmed that it would purchase between 150,000 and 200,000 units in total, with some units heading to ride-sharing platform Uber. A move that was likely secured by the ongoing transition to electrification, Tesla stock went soaring, giving the automaker its first trillion-dollar valuation. Hertz is already offering Model 3 units on its website, and a statement from the company shortly after the deal indicated some vehicles would be available sometime in November.\nCEO Elon Musk confirmed last week that Hertz did not receive any specific discounts or deals in purchasing the Model 3s. However, last night, he also stated that Hertz and Tesla had not entered a written or contractual partnership in response to the company’s massive surge in stock price over the previous week.\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\n“If any of this [stock price] is based on Hertz, I’d like to emphasize that no contract has been signed yet. Tesla has far more demand than production, therefore we will only sell cars to Hertz for the same margin as to consumers. Hertz deal has zero effect on our economics,” Musk Tweeted.\n\nYou’re welcome!\nIf any of this is based on Hertz, I’d like to emphasize that no contract has been signed yet.\nTesla has far more demand than production, therefore we will only sell cars to Hertz for the same margin as to consumers.\nHertz deal has zero effect on our economics.\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 2, 2021\n\n\nHertz responded to Musk’s statement but never acknowledged the lack of legally binding paperwork that would effectively confirm the company’s purchase of 100,000 cars. “As we announced last week, Hertz has made an initial order of 100,000 Tesla electric vehicles and is investing in new EV charging infrastructure across the company’s global operations,” Hertz said to Bloomberg in an emailed statement. “Deliveries of the Teslas already have started. We are seeing very strong early demand for Teslas in our rental fleet, which reflects market demand for Tesla vehicles.”\nTechnically, Hertz could pull out of the 150,000 vehicle figure and purchase fewer units. However, that seems unlikely due to the plans it has to send at least 50,000 units to Uber for ride-sharing and rental services. Additionally, the company has already started offering the Model 3 as a potential vehicle in some markets. Additionally, Hertz Interim CEO Mark Fields said that “initial interest is exceeding our expectations. It shows that our message got through.”\nTesla stock has gained over 50% of its value in the past month. However, Musk’s Tweet caused a slight slide, with shares dropping as much as 5.2% in the morning. The stock has rebounded slightly and is only down 1.65% at the time of writing.\nI’d love to hear from you! If you have any comments, concerns, or questions, please email me at joey@teslarati.com.

      "description": "Tesla officially opened its Supercharger Network to non-Tesla EV owners in the Netherlands on November 1st. Non-Tesla EV owners have already started sharing their experiences with the Supercharger Network online.\n\n\n\nHyundai Ioniq owner Inse van houts shared his experience at a Tesla Supercharger station at Tilburg, the wool capital of the Netherlands, located in the southern province of North Brabant. He gets footage of Tesla employees test charging a Porsche Taycan at the station, showing the company’s efforts to provide service to all EVs.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt works! Charging the Ford Mach-e on a Tesla Supercharger in Naarden pic.twitter.com/QScMjxlwAy— Luc (@lucbronk) November 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\n\n\n\nThen the EV owner starts charging his 2017 Hyundai Ioniq 2 using the Tesla app. After opening the app and connecting his vehicle, he discussed Tesla’s charging rates, including the company’s membership program.\n\n\n\nNon-Tesla owners who join the program will be charged the same charging rates as Tesla owners. The Ioniq 2 owner learns that the membership program will be €13 ($15) a month. The charging membership reveals Tesla’s ever-growing revenue opportunities.\n\n\n\n“The good thing about the membership is you can cancel it monthly, like basically, you can get a membership just to go on holiday and then afterward you can cancel it. It’sIt’s crazy good,” the Ioniq 2 owner stated.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust charged with the @PolestarCars Polestar 2 on the @Tesla @TeslaCharging in Breukelen the Netherlands. Good experience, charging starts within 10 seconds, max charging rate 46 kW (cold battery; 62% soc). Only cable length will be a challange for non-Tesla EVs! pic.twitter.com/k3mcmYlKbE— Reijer Kok (@ReijerKok) November 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Ioniq 2 owner shares that the only issue with charging at the Tesla station is the adapter, which does not connect perfectly with his car because of the charging port’s design. However, his vehicle does complete a charging session with no issues. In its announcement, Tesla notes that EV owners have 2 minutes to connect the charging cable to their cars after selecting the charting stall number in the app. The company also stated that only EVs with CCS connections could use Superchargers during the pilot stage.\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, Elon Musk shared that Europe, China, and most parts of the world use the same connector, so opening the Supercharger Network would be “fairly easy to do.” Recent videos, like the one discussed above, and pictures reveal that is pretty much the case with the open Supercharger Network in the Netherlands. Musk said that an adapter would be needed for EVs in North America.\n\n\n\n“So we developed our own connector, which in my opinion actually the best connector. It’sIt’s small and light and looks good. So an adapter is needed to work for EVs in North America. But people could buy this adapter. And we anticipate having it available at the Superchargers as well if people don’t sort of steal them or something,” he said.\n\n\n\nCheck out Telsa’s open Supercharger stations in the Netherlands below!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Teslarati team would appreciate hearing from you.

      "description": "Not long after the Cybertruck was unveiled, Elon Musk confirmed on Twitter that Tesla would be offering a matte black option for the all-electric pickup truck. What has been relatively unknown until today was that Tesla seems to have created such a vehicle, or at least a model of the Cybertruck in matte black. And just as expected, it looks absolutely incredible. \n\n\n\nThe image of the matte black Cybertruck was recently shared on the r/TeslaMotors subreddit, though it was taken from the Instagram page of a former Tesla Aerodynamics Engineer. The picture was simple, showing the Cybertruck in the background and the next-generation Roadster in the foreground. The Cybertruck’s color was an unmistakable matte black in the photo, which gave the vehicle a very domineering look. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\n\n\n\nSo far, Tesla has built at least two functioning silver Cybertruck prototypes. One was the vehicle that was used for demonstrations and test drives during the Cybertruck unveiling in late 2019, and another was recently sighted at the Castle Airport in Atwater, California. The recently-sighted Cybertruck seemed different than the initial functional silver prototype, as it was fitted with side mirrors, what appeared to be a larger windshield, and a shorter hood. \n\n\n\nTesla has also showcased some non-functional Cybertruck models, however. During the unveiling, the company brought out what appeared to be a full-scale model of the Cybertruck finished in matte gray. The model provided a good contrast to the brushed silver look of the fully functional prototype, and it also gave a pretty fair idea of how the all-electric pickup truck would look like with a wrap. Considering that no matte black Cybertrucks have been spotted in motion to date, the vehicle in the recently shared image might be a full-sized model as well. \n\n\n\nTesla Cybertruck on stage at unveiling event in Los Angeles. Nov. 21, 2019 (Photo: Teslarati)\n\n\n\nIt will not be surprising if more Cybertrucks with different color options are spotted in the coming months. So far, Tesla has noted that it would start initial Cybertruck production at Gigafactory Texas by the end of 2022. As the company approaches this date, more Cybertrucks would likely be tested on public roads. Tesla already seems to be moving towards this, with the company confirming during the Q3 2021 earnings call that it had already built multiple Cybertruck alpha prototypes. \n\n\n\n“As you may have seen recently in social media, we’ve built a number of alphas and are currently testing those to further mature the design. And while those point out a few key additions like rear steer, there are also a number of smaller or less visible improvements though the product is largely true to the initial vision. We’ll continue to work through the product in the beta stages that we’re in now and look to launch that by next year,” Tesla Vice President of Vehicle Engineering Lars Moravy said. \n\n\n\nThe Teslarati team would appreciate hearing from you.

      "description": "The Tesla Model X may be the company’s flagship crossover SUV, but the vehicle has rarely gotten the spotlight this year. Even when Tesla refreshed the Model S and Model X, most of the attention was evidently focused on the Model S and its Plaid variant, which proceeded to destroy every comparable gas-powered vehicle in its class. \n\n\n\nBut as it turns out, Tesla has also made some notable improvements to the new Model X Long Range. The company has just not been highlighting them yet. Fortunately, and as shared online by electric vehicle enthusiast @tempermanant, Tesla’s application documents to the EPA have provided some hints as to what exactly changed between last year’s Model X series and this year’s refreshed flagship SUV. \n\n*NEWS*Refreshed Model X LR will be lighter, more powerfulCompared to '20 Model X LR • 14% reduction in battery weight• 13% increase in battery specific energy• Power increased by more than 30%, equipped AC magnetic motors both front &amp; rear• 4% reduction in curve weight pic.twitter.com/oOzW0vawdl— temp (@tempermanant) October 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that Tesla’s filings for the 2021 Model X are only true for the Long Range variant, which has already started deliveries. Filings for the Model X Plaid, which features three electric motors and near-supercar performance, are yet to be made available. This is quite different from Tesla’s filings for the 2020 Model X, which represented both the base Model X Long Range Plus and the top-tier Model X Performance. \n\n\n\nA look at the documents shows that the refreshed Model X is lighter than its predecessor, with the new flagship SUV having a curb weight of 5,219 lbs. compared to the 2020 Model X Long Range Plus’ 5,437 lbs. This ~4% weight reduction seems to be partly due to the fact that the new Model X’s battery is ~14% lighter than last year’s Model X Long Range Plus. Tesla’s filings note that the new Model X is fitted with a battery that weighs 537 kg (1,183 lbs). In comparison, the Model X Long Range Plus featured a battery that weighed 625 kg (1,377 lbs). \nTesla Model X refresh gets in-depth exterior and interior walkthrough [Video]\n\n\n\nDespite being lighter, however, the new Model X Long Range is about 30% more powerful than its Long Range Plus predecessor. The new Model X now features two AC Permanent Magnet Motors, with the front being rated at 243 kW and the rear being rated at 248 kW. This is quite an improvement over the Model X Long Range Plus, which featured a front AC Permanent Magnet Motor rated at 180 kW and a rear AC Induction Motor rated at 189 kW. \n\n\n\nWhat is quite interesting here is that Tesla’s filings for the new Model X are so far only true for the flagship crossover SUV’s base variant. Needless to say, Tesla’s filings for the Model X Plaid would likely be even more compelling, and it would likely show even more drastic improvements compared to the already stellar 2020 Model X Performance. For context, last year’s Model X Performance was listed with a front AC Permanent Magnet Motor rated at 151 kW and a rear AC Induction motor rated at 273 kW. It would not be a surprise if the Model X Plaid’s three electric motors end up blowing these specs out of the water. \n\n\n\nCheck out Tesla’s filings for the new Model X Long Range in the document below. \n\n2021-Model-X by Simon Alvarez on Scribd\n\nAnd Tesla’s filings for last year’s Model X Long Range Plus and Model X Performance could be viewed below. \n2020-Model-X by Simon Alvarez on Scribd\n\nDon’t hesitate to contact us with news tips.
